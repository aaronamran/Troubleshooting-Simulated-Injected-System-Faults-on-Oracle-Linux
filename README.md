# Troubleshooting Simulated Injected System Faults on Oracle Linux
This homelab project simulates system faults on Oracle Linux VM to practice troubleshooting skills. It is optimised for low-resource environments, ideal for single-laptop homelabs and virtual setups.
The idea is to run the provided script to randomise system issues that will happen to provide a black-box environment, and troubleshoot those issues in a strategical approach.

2. [


## Preparation and Initial Setup
- Download Oracle Linux ISO version 9.6 from [https://yum.oracle.com/oracle-linux-isos.html](https://yum.oracle.com/oracle-linux-isos.html). Install it in VirtualBox and use 4096MB of RAM, 2 CPUs and 20GB storage
- Power on the VM. Select the suitable language and on the screen shown as below, setup the Installation Destination, Root Password and User Creation <br />

- In Installation Destination, select the disk where the OS will be installed on. Click Done when ready <br />

- In Root Password, set the root password and confirm it. A simple password like `sysadmin` for the sake of this homelab is acceptable. Press Done twice since the password used is not strong enough <br />

- In User Creation, create a user account. Simple login credentials are enough <br />

- Begin the installation and let it complete <br />

- In the Oracle Linux VM, run the following script to randomise problems that will occur in the VM
  ```

  done

  ```



## Troubleshooting Approach
- Step	Goal	Example Tools
1. Basic Health Check	Is the system alive, usable, responsive?	uptime, top, free -m, df -h
2. Recent Logs	Any obvious issues reported?	journalctl -xe, dmesg, /var/log/messages
3. System Services	Any failed services?	systemctl --failed, systemctl list-units --state=failed
4. Disk & Mounts	Disk full? Mount broken?	df -h, mount -a, /etc/fstab
5. Network Connectivity	DNS? Gateway? SSH?	ping, dig, ip a, ip r, ss -tuln
6. User Access	Can users sudo? SSH? Login?	id, sudo -l, getent passwd, last
7. Scheduled Jobs	Are cron jobs breaking things?	crontab -l, /etc/cron*, log checks
8. SELinux/Permissions	Is access denied unexpectedly?	getenforce, audit2why, ls -Z
9. Application Layer	Is anything expected missing/broken?	App-specific logs, configs
10. Investigate Deeper	Now dig into suspicious leads	grep logs, check service configs, try restarts, etc
